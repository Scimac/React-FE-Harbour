In Redux, slices and reducers are closely related concepts, but they serve different purposes in managing the application state. Let's compare them:

1. **Reducers:**

   - **Purpose:** Reducers are pure functions responsible for specifying how the application's state changes in response to dispatched actions.
   - **Functionality:** Reducers take the current state and an action as input, and return a new state object representing the updated state.
   - **Usage:** Reducers are typically defined as switch statements or lookup tables that handle specific action types and update corresponding parts of the state.

   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
       switch (action.type) {
         case 'INCREMENT':
           return { count: state.count + 1 };
         case 'DECREMENT':
           return { count: state.count - 1 };
         default:
           return state;
       }
     };
     ```

2. **Slices:**

   - **Purpose:** Slices are predefined bundles of actions and reducers that encapsulate a specific portion of the application state.
   - **Functionality:** Slices contain both the reducer function and action creators for a particular slice of the state. They simplify the process of defining and organizing Redux logic for individual parts of the state.
   - **Usage:** Slices are created using the `createSlice` function from Redux Toolkit, which automatically generates action types and action creators based on the provided reducer logic.

   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

     const counterSlice = createSlice({
       name: 'counter',
       initialState: { count: 0 },
       reducers: {
         increment: state => {
           state.count += 1;
         },
         decrement: state => {
           state.count -= 1;
         },
       },
     });

     export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
     export default counterSlice.reducer;
     ```

**Key Differences:**

- Reducers are lower-level functions responsible for handling state updates based on actions, while slices provide a higher-level abstraction for organizing and managing state logic.
- Reducers are typically defined independently and combined into a root reducer, while slices encapsulate both the reducer function and action creators for a specific part of the state.
- Slices simplify the creation of action types and action creators by automatically generating them based on the reducer logic, reducing boilerplate code.

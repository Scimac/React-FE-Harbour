### Immer Library

- Immer is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of immutable state management by allowing you to write code that looks like it's mutating the state directly, but in reality, it produces a new immutable state. 
- It provides a convenient way to update nested state objects without mutating the original data structures.
### Key Features

1. **Immutability with Mutability Syntax:** Immer allows you to work with immutable data structures using regular mutable syntax, making code easier to read and write.

2. **Automatic Immutability:** When you modify the state within an Immer produce function, Immer automatically ensures that the original data remains unchanged, and a new immutable copy is created.

3. **Support for Nested State Updates:** Immer simplifies the process of updating nested state objects by handling the creation of copies and updates to nested properties automatically.

4. **Integration with Redux and React:** Immer can be seamlessly integrated with Redux and React applications, providing a convenient way to manage immutable state in complex applications.

### Installation

Install Immer via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install immer
# or
yarn add immer
```

### Usage Example

Consider a scenario where you have a nested state object representing a user profile:

```javascript
const state = {
  user: {
    id: 1,
    name: "John",
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      country: "USA"
    }
  }
};
```

#### Vanilla JavaScript Approach (Without Immer)

Without Immer, updating nested state objects requires manual cloning and updating of nested properties, which can be error-prone and verbose:

```javascript
const updatedState = {
  ...state,
  user: {
    ...state.user,
    address: {
      ...state.user.address,
      city: "San Francisco"
    }
  }
};
```

#### Immer Approach

With Immer, you can use a produce function to update nested state objects in a more concise and intuitive way:

```javascript
import produce from 'immer';

/*
produce takes in two arguments - 

	1. original state and 
	2. a function which has access to a draft state (immer generated) 
	
 draft state can be modified in place and immer handkes the structured cloning under the hood 
*/
const updatedState = produce(state, draftState => {
  draftState.user.address.city = "San Francisco";
});
```

#### Comparison:
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Requires manual cloning and updating of nested properties, leading to verbose and error-prone code.
- **Immer:** Simplifies the process by allowing you to directly modify nested state objects within a produce function, producing a new immutable state automatically.

#### Conclusion:
- Immer provides a convenient and intuitive way to manage immutable state in JavaScript applications, especially when dealing with nested data structures. 
- By simplifying the process of updating state objects, Immer improves code readability and reduces the risk of introducing bugs related to state mutability.
